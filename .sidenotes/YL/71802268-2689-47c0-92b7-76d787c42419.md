#### anchor.comments.cleanWholeLine

(for single-line comments only). when this is checked, when deleting the sidenote, extension will clean the whole line including all asoociated text that you might have add to it.

#### anchor.comments.affectNewlineSymbols (TODO)

when adding a sidenote, new line will be automatically created for this purpose and deleted when deleting sidenote. This has some performance penalty. When this is off, you can call 'annotate' command on existing line and created comment will keep all the text already present on this line as prefix.
