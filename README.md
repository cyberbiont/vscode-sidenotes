# Sidenotes

## Why / Motivation

As they say it, good code documents itself. But sometimes you need to make some extended notes regarding to particular part of your code, describing *why* your wrote it in such a way.  There also could be some ideas, detailed 'todos', issue analysis, conclusions, alternative code variants that you what to recall later or something alike. That big notes doesn't do well as simple comments, because they clutter your code. Also, such notes are often private in nature and are not intended to be seen for other people, who might happen to read / edit your code. With usual comments there's no usual way to help it, if your code is commited under VCS other than delete them altogether. So, the only solution is to 'externalize' your notes but keep them anchored to certain lines of your code so that you can easily peek/edit them at any time.

Also, comments often tend to distract you. Vscode has no mechanism to hide/fold all comments .

## How it works

Sidenotes content are stored in separate files, that are linked to the source document via the special comment in your code. 'Content' side and 'source document' side are linked via the common unique id that is read from anchor comment and is used to fetch associated content from content file.

> Tip: if collaborate on code with other people who aren't acquainted with sidenite comments, it can be a good idea to place some explanation/warning in your repository README so that your collaborators ignore these comments and won't delete them.
>
> If they do, though, you can restore it though VCS)

## Features

This extension allows you to annotate your code with external notes in inobtrusive way, that are stored separately from your document and are shown as in pop-ups on hover.  

- create, edit and delete sidenotes
- single-line or multiline comments are supported.
- tooltip updates as you are editing and saving your note;
- use can use vscode or external Markdown editor to edit your note (I recommend Typora);
- local worskspace 

### Multiple anchors

You can can have more than one anchor for content file, if you manually copy anchor comment inside or between documents.

One thing to keep in mind os that when you copy it, the copy's tooltip won't be updated until the next time you edit and save content file, re-scan all anchors with **scan** command (of course, also happens on vscode window reload).

## Supported extensions and languages

### source document

Sidenotes uses VSCode 'toggle comment' action to generate anchors, so it allows extension to be agnostic about what language the document you are annotating is written in. Therefore, you can annotate any file format that allows comments inside it, you can even annotate markdown sidenote itself with other sidenotes over it (there's gotchas in this case though).

Nevertheless, it is recommended to set some restrictions as to what kind of files can be annotated, to speed up  workspace-wide scan (whicj is performed on 'migrate' command, for example) by excluding certain extensions and directories. You can do it with glob (see  [Configuration](#Configuration-options))

### content files

By default, sidenotes expects your contents to be written in Markdown .md file is what is created on default when you add new sidenote. It's generally the best choice since it allows for simple editing and useful features such as code fences and syntax highliting.  For markdown files you can choose between default VScode editor and Typora.

If you want to display an image or some other type of html-supportedcontent, you can do so by wrapping it inside markdown file.

(TODO) The possibility to append other file types as content files is still appealing so that you can use Mind map files (for example .mmap) . Those contents won't be displayed in tooltip but you will be able to open associated file right from your document.

## Configuration options

### Global options

#### behaviour.autostart

By default, extension automatically starts and activates markers in current document. If you turn this off, you'll have to run 'display' or 'annotate' command for extension to initialize.

### File system

#### storage.defaultEditorService (TODO)

By default, sidenotes open in vscode's second panel for editing. You can specify 'Typora' here to open files in Typora (you must have Typora installed in your system and  'typora' executable in the system PATH).

More editors can be supported in future.

#### storage.files.notesSubfolder

if the File Storage is used (which is by default) defines a subfolder inside your workspace, where sidenotes content files will be stored.

#### storage.files.contentFileExtension (TODO)

defines file extension. By default it is '.md'. You can change it to '.markdown' or '.mdown'

#### sources.fileFormatsAllowedForTransfer (TODO)

File extensions which support initial content placement feature (see)

#### sources.excludeFromAnnotation

A glob expression(link to glob) to exclude files and directories from scanning during Migrate command.



### Anchor configuration

The extension uses certain Regex, based on unique id, to identify sidenote anchors in your source document and operate on them. 

#### anchor.comments.cleanWholeLine

(for single-line comments only). when this is checked, when deleting the sidenote, extension will clean the whole line including all asoociated text that you might have add to it.

#### anchor.comments.affectNewlineSymbols (TODO)

when adding a sidenote, new line will be automatically created for this purpose and deleted when deleting sidenote. This has some performance penalty. When this is off, you can call 'annotate' command on existing line and created comment will keep all the text already presenton this line as prefix.

### Design

#### anchor.marker.salt

In addition to Uuid extension prepends it with Unicode symbol to disambiguate with other uuids that might happen in your code.

By default it is  ðŸ•® with whitespace before UUID. Therefore, you can you this symbol to target your sidenote comments with other styling extensions (see about [styling](#Prefixing and additional styling sidenotes : tips)). You can change this symbol, however, since it is included in regexp search, all comments that use the former symbol will stop to be identified by extension. To fix that, yo can manually run RegExp search and replace on your workspace to transform all your anchors to new format, however, it is not recommended . 

#### anchor.marker.prefix

Adds the string that you specify here at the beginning of the inserted marker and removes it on sidenote deletion. Note that in constrast to 'before' setting this is the actual text that will be added, i.e. it is a part of the document and it will be visible when extension is deactivated. Useful if you want to hook your sidenotes to some coment-styling extension (see [styling](#Prefixing and additional styling sidenotes : tips)).

#### anchor.design.before

adds the string that you specify as a pseudo-element at the start of all of your markers.  

#### anchor.design.after

Is shown at the end of the marker, and stays in place of it when the marker is compressed. By default it is ðŸ•®, you can specify your own string or Unicode symbol here. Changes to visualize sidenote's state.

#### anchor.design.gutterIcon

Whether to show icon in gutter. If you don't like them or use other extension which shows gutter icons (see [styling](#Prefixing and additional styling sidenotes : tips)) you can turn this off.

#### anchor.design.ruler

Whether sidenotes will be shown in Overview ruler 

#### anchor.design.compressMarker

Effectively hides the uuid part of markers to reduce cluttering by applying a negative letter-spacing to marker decoration. This has a few downsides, such as precise selecting marker with mouse become a non-trivial task. Use Ctrl-C - Ctrl-X commands t copy/ cut the whole line.

### Multi-line (block) vs single-line comments

There is a possibilty to use either single-line comments or multi-line. Advantages of multi-line comments:

- straightforward selection of comment when marker hiding mode is engaged.

- ability to add sidenotes to the end of existing line of code.

- ability to have several comments (i.e. sidenotes) in one line, 

- ability to place comments in between your code lines. 

	Generally,  later two couldn't be considered good practice though, but if you need these features you can turn it on. 

The main con: in certain language syntaxes (for example, bash shellScript and Pug) multi-line comments are not available or doesn't work (generally, if editor.action.blockComment is not feasible for current language, syntax extension must fall back to editor.action.commentLine, in this case everything will work, but not all extensions do so) .We cannot provide fallback manually since executeCommand method does not return anything in this case so we cannot detect if block comment was toggled successfully. (the only way is to manually check if the current line length has changed)

All taken to all, using single-line comments is recommended.

Using single-line comments engages Vscode editor.action.commentLine, which effectively toggle comments on the *whole* line. So, you won't be able to add sidenote comment at the end of the line of code; you'll always need a dedicated line for your note. Besides, when 'folding' your marker, with single-line comments if can be problematic to properly select the whole comment (if you want to manually move in to some other place) since comment lacks ending characters that can indicate that selection is done correctly. One way to do this right is to use ctrl + L shortcut to select the whole line.

With single-line sidenotes, you can insert sidenotes inside block comments.

One thing to remeber is that once you switch comments type in settings, extension will still properly display other comment type sidenotes, but won't be able to properly delete them (since another cmmand is used to toggle comment off). So you will have to do it manually.

In some languages (html, css, php) there's only 'block' comments available, so sidenote comments will be having an ending tag.

## Commands

### Main (available from context menu)

#### Annotate

The main command that is used for both creating new and opening existing sidenotes (depending on whether you use it on the line that already contains sidenote), so you can use just one key binding for both. If called over existing sidenote anchor, it opens associated content file for editing. If resource is not found, it displays a dialog window, where you can choose from several options:

- *delete sidenote* - deletes orphaned anchor comment
- *re-create* - creates new file for this anchor comment keeping id;
- *look-up* - opens file browser for you to select directory where file is contained. See [migrating notes](#Migrating notes to new project (if file storage is used))

#### Delete sidenote 

Deletes both anchor from your document and associated content resource. (TODO: ask for resource deletion)

#### Reset

Resets decorations for document , rescans and rebuilds them (in case If something has gone awry).

#### Internalize

Writes sidenote's content into document inside a commented lined and deletes sidenote. Useful for short unformatted notes and reminders. Can be considered a reverse to initialContent feature.

#### Toggle full markers

Compresses/ decompresses sidenote markers.

### Cleaning

#### Prune

Command is used to delete all broken notes in current document.

#### Prune empty

Command is used to delete all broken notes in current document.

#### Clean extraneous 

Removes all extraneous (orphan) content records from storage (files from the notes subfoder in case of file storage)

#### Migrate (File storage - specific)

Scans your current workspace for anchors (TODO multiple workspaces) and performs global lookup for missing content files. See [migrating notes](#Migrating notes to new project (if file storage is used)) 



## Removing anchors during build

Tip: if your workflow involves some kind of biuld process, usually you'll want to delete sidenote comments during build process. 

If you do it on 'delete-all-comments' basis, using your minifier, for example, sidenote comments will be deleted together with all others 9since they are just simple comments). 

If you want to delete sidenote comments only you'll probably need Regexp to match them.

## Internalize and externalize content

For you convenience, when you create new sidenote, if you have some text selected, this text is removed from your document and placed inside sidenote, so you don't have to cut and paste it by hand.

On the other hand, if you want for some reason to place note contents back into your document, you can use **internalize** command, which will pit sidenotes content into your document in place of sidenote anchor. 

## Notes storage

By default, local directory inside your workspace folder is used to store notes. This lets you put your sidenotes under VCS control and commit them with the rest of your project (see VCS). However, because storage is workspace-bound,  this imposes some difficulties, one of them is the need to migrate your notes, if you want to move/copy your source document to another project/workspace.

Note that, in order for extension with file storage used to work, you need to have workspace open in VSCode. You cannot annotate documents that are outside of currently opened workspace, and, if you try, the extension will warn you. 

### Broken notes

*Broken* sidenote is defined as note, for which there's a leftover comment anchor in your source document, but  associated content file is missing. Extension automatically detects such notes and highlights them in red. When you are trying to open 'broken' sidenote There' s a couple of options opened for you. You can:

- re-create missing file
- delete broken comment
- look for missing sidenote file

In latter case you have to specify the directory when the sidenote is stored through 'open file' dialog. Make sure you select the directory that *immideately* has the file (nested files are not detected).

You also can use **'prune broken**' command, that will delete all broken sidenote anchors from current document.

### Empty sidenotes

*Empty* sidenote is defined as note, which content file is empty. Thay are automatically detected and highlighted. You can use **'prune empty' command, to delete these notes from current document together with content files.

### Migrating notes to new project (if file storage is used)

There will be times you'll want to move your files to another project. If you just do it without copying sidenotes directory with them, you will  left up with broken notes.  To manage this, **migrate** command exists. It scans all sidenotes in the current workspace and tries to find their content files in the directory that you specify. So, the proposed order of actions is this: you move/copy some annotated files into another project; you open this project as workspace in VScode; you run 'migrate' command and specify for lookup the former sidenotes folder from the project you have moved you files from. Extension checks sidenotes in your current workspace and copies needed content files to your new new project.

Then you can run **'cleanExtraneous'** command on your original project, to delete any content files left that are not used anymore.

### Other storage types (to be implemented)

Potentially, note's contents can be stored in centralized database or cloud service (such as Evernote). This has some benefits, (no need to migrate your files between projects) but makes sidenotes independent of VCS control (see VCS considerations).

## Prefixing and additional styling sidenotes : tips

You can prefix your sidenote with some short description. It will look like this: 

// short description: ðŸ•®

You can add TODO and any special

You can also add it as suffix: 

// ðŸ•® short description

To make it stand out, your can prefix sidenote with !, ? etc. special characters. I recommend [Better comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) or [Deco comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GuillaumeIsabelle.gixdeko-comments) for this purpose.

You can use [Comment anchors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExodiusStudios.comment-anchors) to make your sidenotes show up in comment anchors navigation pane . You can prexif them with  desired anchors of target all your sidenotes, to do so, create custom anchor type in comment anchor settings like this:

```json
"commentAnchors.tags.list": [
    {
            "tag": "âœŽ",
            "iconColor": "blurple",
            "highlightColor": "#896afc",
            "scope": "file"
	}
]
```

After this your sidenotes will .



## VCS considerations

It's up to you whether you want to commint your sidenotes to VCS or leave them off. Commiting has the benefit that any version you checkout with VCS will have sidenotes in accordance to this version state. It is useful if sidenote is coupled tightly with the code and you want to keep ot 'in sync' with annotated document.  Therefore, it is generally recommended. But, your notes won't be private that way (though you can something like node-cipher to encrrypt your notes folder TODO).

You can also exclude your sidenotes folder from VCS. In that case, you get notes privacy (they won't be commited and therefore shared with other collaborators through VCS), but you are at risk of getting 'extraneous'  or 'broken' notes if you check out the version when sidenote anchor comment still doesn't exist, or, otherwise, still exists though you could have deleted note and content file in one of later versions. However, if you really want the sidenote to be independent of VCS, it's the way to go.

If you want to exclude, it is recommended that you do it via global [git exclude](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files#explicit-repository-excludes) rather than .gitignore. 

## Gotchas

### Cut  / copy markers

When you manually move / copy your anchor markers, the decorations need to be updated to account for new marker position, until then they will be rendered at their old position. Sadly, VSCode currently has no way of detecting cut/copy/paste events, so the closest event you can get after moving your marker is *document save* event.  On this event extension will scan changes and update decorations if any markersa are involved. So, when you manually paste fragment of code that includes sidenote markers, you'll have to save you document to update view.

When you cut fragment of code that contains sidenote markers,
